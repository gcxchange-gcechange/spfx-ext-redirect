# Redirect Dialog Extension

## Summary

The Redirecting Dialog Extension is a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) extension that notifies users when a feature has been moved to a new site. The dialog is fully bilingual (English and French) and provides two action buttons:

- Explore Home Page ‚Äì Redirects users to the site‚Äôs main home page.

- Go to New Feature ‚Äì Takes users directly to the new site where the feature now resides.

This extension ensures users are clearly informed about the feature relocation while offering quick navigation options in both supported languages.

## Prerequisites

## 1. In the onInit function modify the URL‚Äôs query parameter (?search=) with the term or keyword you want to search for.

```ts

    const myParam = params.get('redirect'); // üîÅ Replace with URL‚Äôs query parameter
```
